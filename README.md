# Web Volume "remote" control

This simple Sinatra app manages the volume on systems with
[ALSA](http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page)
(most GNU/Linux distributions as far as I know).

It's basically a web page where you can interact with your computer's
volume via a web-browser.

## How does it work?

Clone the code, `bundle install` and `rackup`. You should be able to
access the app on: http://localhost:9292.
